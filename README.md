Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am a software engineer, particularly interested in systems and reliability. My [linkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manugarg/) has work related info, so won't repeat that here.

- My current [blog](https://medium.com/@manugarg) ([previous, more personal, blog](https://manugarg.com) - last updated 2010).
- ðŸ”­ I currently maintain the following projects outside of work:
    - [Cloudprober](https://github.com/cloudprober/cloudprober) - an active probing software used by a bunch of large organizations
    - [Pacparser](https://github.com/manugarg/pacparser) - C and python library to add PAC file parsing capability
    - [Page Notes](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/page-notes/omjdheidbhoghpfdnndkgoelfiogjfla) - a productivity chrome extension, not open-source
- My first big contribution to open-source was finding (and fixing, but finding was the hard part) [a nasty bug in the squid web-proxy](https://www.manugarg.com/2007/08/hacking-squid.html).
- In my previous life, as part of my system internals exploration, I wrote a bunch of [articles](https://articles.manugarg.com). Following two articles are still [referenced](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22articles.manugarg.com%2Fsystemcallinlinux2_6.html%22+OR+%22articles.manugarg.com%2Faboutelfauxiliaryvectors.html%22) quite a lot, including in some university courses:
    - [Sysenter Based System Call Mechanism in Linux 2.6](https://articles.manugarg.com/systemcallinlinux2_6.html)
    - [About ELF Auxiliary Vectors](https://articles.manugarg.com/aboutelfauxiliaryvectors.html)
